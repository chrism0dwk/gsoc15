Google Summer of Code 2015, InFER project tests
===============================================

This repository contains the test code for test 2 of the
InFER GSOC 2015 project.  The file unitTest.cpp requires an 
implementation of Pdf class hierarchy.  The file Pdf.hpp contains
the interface to a set of derived classes returning the probability 
distribution function of various probability distributions.

Class Pdf is a pure virtual class declaring the virtual method

virtual double Pdf::pdf(const double x)

This method returns the value of the pdf for a probability 
distribution f(x; theta) given a value of the associated random
variable x with parameters theta (set in the constructor).

Test 2 requires that Pdf.cpp is modified, with derived classes 
"Normal" and "Gamma" implemented.  Note that Pdf::pdf(const double x) is 
pure virtual so that derived classes are forced to provide their own
implementations of the appropriate pdf.

Test 3 requires the development of a Makefile to compile both Pdf.hpp 
and unitTest.cpp into a binary executable.
